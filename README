orbdetpy - Python library for orbit determination

Author : Shiva Iyer <shiva.iyer AT utexas DOT edu>

Introduction
------------

This is orbdetpy, a library of Python routines for orbit determination.
It is built on top of the Orekit astrodynamics framework.

orbdetpy is free software, distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.

Features
--------

The force model for orbit propagation currently includes:

1) EGM96 gravity field up to degree and order 360.
2) Solid tides owing to the Sun and Moon.
3) FES 2004 ocean tide model up to degree and order 100.
4) Simple exponential model for atmospheric drag.
5) Solar radiation pressure.
6) Third body perturbations from the Sun and Moon.

The measurement model supports range and range-rate readings. Filtering
is done using Orekit's Extended Kalman Filter or our Unscented Kalman
Filter.

Future Work
-----------

The following tasks are under consideration. Community contributions are
always welcome.

1) The addition of other atmospheric models supported by Orekit.
2) Support for attitude dependent drag and solar radiation pressure.
3) Other measurement types including angles data.
4) A batch least squares implementation.
5) Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother.
6) Estimation of dynamic parameters beyond just position and velocity.
   Also, support for consider-only parameters.
7) Parametric analysis i.e. the ability to pass-through certain
   measurement types.

Prerequisites
-------------

1) Python 3.6+ must be installed with the packages numpy, scipy, pyjnius.
2) A Java compiler, development environment, and runtime must be
   installed from <http://openjdk.java.net/>.
3) Hipparchus 1.3+ <https://hipparchus.org/> and Orekit 9.2+
   <https://www.orekit.org/> are used for all astrodynamics functions.
   As a convenience, the JAR files for these libraries and associated
   data files are provided under the lib/ and data/ folders, respectively.

Configuration
-------------

orbdetpy uses JSON files to store settings, measurements and estimation
results. The file examples/example_cfg.json is a sample. The JAVA_HOME
variable in this file must point to your Java Development Kit installation.

Examples
--------

The following example programs may be found in the 'examples' folder.

1) radar.py : Shows how orbdetpy may be used for orbit determination from
   radar measurements. The file example_cfg.json shows settings that drive
   propagation and estimation. example_input.json contains dummy entries
   to show the structure of the measurement inputs. Both JSON files must
   be updated to include your own ground stations and measurement data.

Bug Reports
-----------

Comments, criticisms and bug reports are very welcome and may be sent to
the package maintainer by email or the project's website.
